Hello! I'm Ren, a third year Ph.D. student at the University of Colorado, Boulder in the [PhyPID](https://phypid.org/) group under Prof. Jed Brown. So far, most of my research time has been spent adding features to our in house code bases (Ratel and libCEED) to enable more efficient solid mechanics modeling. I am funded by [the PSAAP center at CU Boulder](https://micromorph.gitlab.io/projectwebsite/index.html).

My long-term research interests consist of computational neuroscience and biomechanics modeling - notably the intersection of the two. For the remainder of my PhD work I am hoping to work on modeling the mechanical activation of neurons (touch sensations or ultrasonic activation/destruction). Long-term, I am interested in modeling the effect of protein modulation/mutation/etc on the behavior of excitable tissues.  

When not in front of a computer, I am usually skiing, trail running, or riding my bike. I also spend my time gardening or attempting to propagate plants.
