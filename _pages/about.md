Hello! I'm Ren, a third year Ph.D. student at the University of Colorado, Boulder in the [PhyPID](https://phypid.org/) group under Prof. Jed Brown.

About research interests here.

When not in front of a computer, I am usually skiing, trail running, or riding my bike. I also spend my time gardening or attempting to propagate plants.
